    Timothy started in his current position in January 2021 as a bit of a “jack of many trades, master of none.” He has experience working in aviation, tourism, telecommunications and music performance. This varied work experience has been valuable in his role as the Executive Operations Manager as he assists in a wide range of behind the scenes areas including IT, HR, Accounting, Operations and General Office Administration. He is especially driven to understand processes, and is energized by working to understand a process well enough to help improve it.

    Tim moved to the Chicago area in 2018 from Alaska, and has also lived in Colorado and Virginia. He earned a B.S. in Piano Performance in 2008, and is particularly interested to better understand what happens in our brains when we create and hear music. When not being a music nerd, Tim can be found nerding out in front of a computer – probably slaying dragons in Tamriel or Azeroth. Nerdfighteria FTW! DFTBA!
